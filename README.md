# 8_puzzle <br/>
Using three different algorithms to solve our problem (8-puzzle game) which requires the numbers from 0 to 8 to be arranged in someway.<br/>
Initially the numbers are shuffled and then we start swap one number with the blank (0 number) to get new states untill we reach the final state 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 we search for the final state using three different search algorithms BFS, DFS and A* search.
